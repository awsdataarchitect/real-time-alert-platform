# Geospatial Processing Implementation Summary

## Task Completed

We have successfully implemented the geospatial processing functionality for the Real-Time Alert Platform as specified in task #10:

- Created Lambda function for geospatial analysis
- Implemented affected area determination
- Set up geospatial indexes in DynamoDB
- Written unit tests for geospatial functions

## Implementation Details

### 1. Lambda Function for Geospatial Analysis

We created a Lambda function (`processGeospatial.js`) that:
- Retrieves alerts with location data but no geospatial processing
- Calculates geohashes for efficient location-based queries
- Determines affected areas based on alert type and severity
- Estimates population impact
- Updates alerts with enhanced geospatial information

### 2. Affected Area Determination

The implementation includes logic to determine affected areas based on:
- Alert type (earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood, etc.)
- Alert severity
- Location type (point, polygon, multi-polygon)

For point locations, we create buffers with radii determined by the alert characteristics. For example, earthquake buffers are calculated based on magnitude using a logarithmic scale.

### 3. Geospatial Indexes in DynamoDB

We added a new Global Secondary Index (GSI) to the Alerts table:
- `ByGeohash` - Indexes alerts by their geohash for efficient location-based queries

We also updated the alert schema to include:
- `geohash` - The geohash string for the alert location
- `locationHash` - Used by the existing `ByLocation` GSI
- `geospatialData` - Object containing detailed geospatial information

### 4. Unit Tests

We created comprehensive unit tests for the geospatial processing functionality, including tests for:
- Geohash calculation
- Neighboring geohash calculation
- Affected area determination
- Population impact estimation
- Alert processing
- Error handling

### 5. Additional Documentation

We created documentation explaining:
- The geospatial processing architecture
- How geohashes are used for indexing
- How affected areas are determined
- How to query alerts by location and proximity

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation fulfills the following requirements from the requirements document:

### Requirement 1.3
> WHEN an alert is processed THEN the system SHALL enrich it with relevant contextual information (location data, severity assessment, recommended actions).

Our implementation enriches alerts with geospatial data including:
- Precise geohash for the location
- Affected area determination
- Population impact estimates

### Requirement 3.1
> WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a real-time map showing active alerts by location and severity.

Our implementation enables efficient geospatial queries that will power the map visualization, allowing:
- Querying alerts by location
- Finding alerts near a specific location
- Displaying affected areas on a map

## Next Steps

The geospatial processing functionality is now ready to be integrated with:
1. The dashboard service for map visualization
2. The alert delivery service for location-based alert targeting
3. The AI insight service for spatial pattern recognition
