## Remaining Issues

### 1. **Module System Inconsistencies** ⚠️ **MEDIUM** (Improved but not fully resolved)
- **Issue**: Still mixing ES6 imports and CommonJS in Lambda functions
- **Examples**:
  ```javascript
  // Some Lambda functions use CommonJS
  const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
  
  // Others use ES6 modules
  import { DynamoDB } from 'aws-sdk';
  ```
- **Impact**: Potential runtime errors in Lambda environment
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on CommonJS for Lambda functions or configure proper ES6 support

### 2. **GraphQL Resolver Implementation** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Complex custom queries still lack complete resolver implementations
- **Missing**: 
  - `searchAlertsByLocation` resolver logic
  - Complex filtering and aggregation resolvers
  - Real-time subscription handlers
- **Impact**: Some API functionality may not work as expected
- **Recommendation**: Complete custom resolver implementations

### 3. **Error Handling Standardization** ⚠️ **LOW**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across services
- **Impact**: Debugging and monitoring challenges
- **Recommendation**: Implement standardized error handling middleware

### 4. **Performance Optimization** ⚠️ **LOW**
- **Issue**: Some database queries still use scan operations
- **Impact**: Performance issues at scale
- **Recommendation**: Optimize query patterns and implement caching
