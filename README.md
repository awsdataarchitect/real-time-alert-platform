# Real-Time Alert Platform

A comprehensive platform that combines AWS generative AI services with next-generation connectivity solutions to provide timely alerts and information about critical events.

## Overview

The Real-Time Alert Platform is designed to provide timely, relevant alerts about critical events by combining AWS generative AI services with next-generation connectivity solutions. The platform collects data from various sources, processes it using AI to extract meaningful insights, and delivers personalized alerts through multiple channels. A responsive dashboard visualizes alert information to support decision-making during critical situations.

## Features

- Real-time alert collection and processing
- Personalized alert delivery
- Advanced visualization dashboard
- AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Multi-channel communication
- Edge computing and offline functionality
- Security and privacy controls
- Integration with external systems
- Scalability and performance
- Accessibility and inclusivity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Architecture

The Real-Time Alert Platform follows a microservices architecture with edge computing capabilities to ensure reliability even in limited connectivity scenarios. The system is designed to be cloud-native, leveraging AWS services for scalability, resilience, and AI capabilities.

## Data Models

### Alert Data Model

The Alert data model is the core entity of the platform, representing critical events that need to be communicated to users. The model includes:

- **Basic Information**: Source, type, category, severity, and status
- **Content**: Headline, description, and instructions
- **Temporal Data**: Start time, end time, and creation/update timestamps
- **Spatial Data**: Location information with geospatial indexing
- **Related Data**: Affected areas, resources, and related alerts
- **AI Insights**: Analysis, recommendations, and confidence scores

The Alert model uses geohashing for efficient location-based queries and includes mechanisms for alert consolidation and deduplication.

#### Key Features

- **Geospatial Indexing**: Using geohash for efficient location-based queries
- **Alert Consolidation**: Mechanism to combine related alerts
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for data integrity
- **Versioning**: Track changes to alerts over time
- **AI Integration**: Structure for AI-generated insights and recommendations
